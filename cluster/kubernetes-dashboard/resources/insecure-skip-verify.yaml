# It's VERY hard to verify that kubernetes certificates are signed by them.
# Mostly due to: https://github.com/kubernetes/dashboard/issues/4684

# Traefik's insecureSkipVerify doesn't validate the internal chain of certifictes
# and therefore allows the entire thing to work. DON'T ACTUALLY RUN THIS IN PRODUCTION
